**Virtual canvas using computer vision:**

->  This project is a Virtual Canvas drawing that allows users to draw on the screen using hand gestures, powered by "computer Vision" techniques. 

->  It uses "Open CV" and "media Pipe" to track hand movements and enable interaction with a digital canvas without the need for physical input devices.  

*Features:*

- Draw using finger gestures  
- Erase drawings with a specific gesture  
- Change colors dynamically  
- Clear the canvas with a hand movement  
- Real-time hand tracking using OpenCV and MediaPipe  

*Technologies Used*
- Python
- OpenCV (for computer vision processing)  
- MediaPipe (for hand tracking)  
- NumPy (for array manipulations)  

 *Installation*
 
1. Clone the repository:  
   " git clone https://github.com/harsharen21/virtual-canvas.git  "
   " cd virtual-canvas  "

2. Install dependencies:  
 "  pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy "
   
4. Run the project:  
  " python virtual_canvas.py  "


*Usage Instructions:*

1.Place the hand infront of the screen to detect.
2. Move your index finger to draw on the screen.  
3. Use a specific gesture (e.g., palm open) to erase.  
4. Switch colors using predefined gestures.  
5. Use a clear gesture to wipe the canvas.
