## 🎨 Overview

A **Virtual Canvas** that enables users to **draw on a screen using hand gestures**.  
This project is powered by **OpenCV** and **MediaPipe** for real-time **hand tracking** and digital drawing **without any physical device**.  

**✨ Key Features**

✅ **Draw using finger gestures**  
✅ **Erase drawings with a specific hand gesture**  
✅ **Change colors dynamically**  
✅ **Clear the entire canvas with a gesture**  
✅ **Real-time hand tracking using OpenCV & MediaPipe**
